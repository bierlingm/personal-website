            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Moritz Bierling is a web developer, researcher, speaker, and strategist. As the owner and principal of Existential Ventures he helps visionary founders to catalyze their projects through strategy, storytelling, and technology. Currently, he works primarily with Holo and Holochain, two sister projects that aim to deliver on the promises the blockchain technology promised but cannot keep. In his work with Exosphere, he has organized a number of educational programs (e.g. the world’s first Ethereum training course), authored a Primer on the emerging discipline of Alternate Reality Design, and now advises the organization on strategy. His work has appeared in a number of blockchain-related and libertarian media outlets such as CoinTelegraph, The Freeman’s Perspective, Bitcoin.com and the School Sucks Project. Having dropped out of university twice, his path has taken him from the most abstract heights of philosophy to the pragmatic truths of an action-oriented life, the bridge between these two extremes being the focus of his current research and communication efforts. In his most recent work, he researched and presented on the use of memes in the formation of culture and the political struggle. Moritz lives in Hamburg, Germany. </p>
